    $q(x)=\displaystyle{\frac{x^2+5}{x-2}}$ 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[(a)] Compute $q'(x)$\\\\\\\\
        \item[(b)] Where is $q'(x)$ undefined? (Think about what values of $x$ result in dividing by zero)\\\\\\\\
        \item[(c)] Where is $q'(x)=0$ (Hint: If the numerator of $q'(x)$ then $q'(x)$ is zero. 
        It is enough to only look for when the numerator is zero)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
        \item[(d)] Find the points of interest and the critical points of $q(x)$.\\\\\\\\

    %\item Find the global maximum and minimum of the function $\displaystyle{f(t)=\frac{t}{1+t^2}}$ on $(-\infty,\infty)$ or explain why they don't exist. Hint: EVT does not apply here, why? How could looking at the end behavior help?\\

How can you maximize the area of the pen (find dimensions for the pen that maximizes the area)? Assume that the barn is as big as needed.

    \item Steve's Dinosaur Park is expanding its Velociraptor/T-Rex exhibit which will lie along a river. There will be 2 Velociraptor pens and 1 T-Rex pen. However, Velociraptors can cross the river, while the T-Rex cannot. Thus, each Velociraptor pen will require 4 sides, while the T-Rex pen will only require 3 sides. All pens must have the same area or one dinosaur species will be jealous of the other. 40,000 feet of fencing are available to create the adjoining pens. Determine the dimensions of each pen that will maximize the combined area of the pens.

    \item You are in charge of building a rectangular storage container with an open top and a volume of $10\ m^{3}$. The base of the box has to be twice as long as it is wide. It costs \$30 per $m^{2}$ to construct the base and \$32 per $m^{2}$ to construct the sides. Call the length, width, and height of the box $l$, $w$, and $h$, respectively. What are the dimensions to create the least expensive box?

    \item You are planning to connect a small island with fiber optic cables to the fiber optic internet grid. The island is 14 miles off of a straight coastline and the nearest point on the grid is 10 miles down the coast from the point directly opposite the island. Laying underwater cables costs twice as much as laying cables on land. Use calculus to solve and justify your work for the questions below. Round mileage values to at least \textbf{4 decimal places}, and round dollar values to \textbf{2 decimal places}.
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
        \item Which combination of underwater and land-based cable will minimize the total cost of the cable? What is the minimum cost if the cable costs $\$50,000$ per mile on land?

        %\item What would happen to your result if the nearest point on the grid from problem 6a were $20$ miles down the coats rather than $10$ miles?
        \newpage
        \item Assume again that the nearest point on the grid was $10$ miles down the coast. Suppose that the underwater cable costs $\alpha$ times as much as cable on land ($\alpha>1$). Which combination of the underwater and land-based cable will minimize the total cost of the cable now? (write your answer in terms of $\alpha$). Interpret your answer.
