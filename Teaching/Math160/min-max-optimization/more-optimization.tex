\begin{enumerate}
    \item Show that the $3x^4-4x^3$ has a local minimum of $-1$ on the interval $[-1,2]$. 
    What $x$-value does this occur at?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

    \item Does the function $3x^4-4x^3$ have a global maximum on the interval $[0,2]$. 
    What $x$-value does this occur at?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

    \item Consider the function $f(x)=x^3-ax$ on the interval $[-3,2]$ where $a$ is a constant.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Find the critical points of $f(x)$ in terms of $a$.\\\\\\\\\\
        %\item Will $f(x)$ always have a global maximum and minimum?\\\\\\
        \item Find a value for $a$ such that there is a local maximum at $x=-2$.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
        %\item Find a value for $a$ such that there is a global maximum at $x=2$.\\\\\\\\\\\\
        \item T/F: There is a value for $a$ such that there is a local minimum or maximum at $x=0$. (Hint: Can $x=0$ be a critical point? When it is, can it also be a local minimum or maximum?)
    \end{itemize}
   \newpage
    \iffalse\item Sketch the graph of a continuous function having the following properties:
	\begin{itemize}
	\begin{multicols}{3}
	\item $f(-3)=-2$
	\item $f(0)=3$
	\item $f(1)=0$
	\item $f'(-3)=0$
	\item $f'(0)=0$
	\item $f'(1)$ is undefined
	\item $f'(x)<0$ for $-\infty<x<-3$, $0<x<1$
	\item $f'(x)>0$ for $-3<x<0$ and $1<x<\infty$
	\item $f''(x)<0$ for $1<x<4$ 
	\item $f''(x)>0$ for $4<x<\infty$ 
	\end{multicols}

    \fi

    \item Create a Counterexample for the following statement: If $f(x)$ is concave down at $x = \i$, then $f(x)$ has a local maximum at $x = \pi$.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
    \item Create a Counterexample for the following statement: Given $f'(x) < 0$ for $x < -4$ and $f'(x) > 0$ for $x > -4$, then there must be a local minimum
    at $x = -4$.
    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
    \item Find the global maximum and minimum of the function $\displaystyle{f(t)=\frac{t}{1+t^2}}$ on $(-\infty,\infty)$ or explain why they don't exist. Hint: How could looking at the end behavior help?\\
