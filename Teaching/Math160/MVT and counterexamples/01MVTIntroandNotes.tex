Suppose $y=f(x)$ is continuous on a closed interval $[a,b]$ and differentiable on the interval's interior $(a,b)$. Then there is at least one point $c$ in $(a,b)$ at which $\displaystyle\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}=f'(c)$

\textbf{Introduction:} \\

This section raises the question, ``Will the instantaneous rate of change at any point on an interval $[a, b]$ ever equal the average rate of change on the interval?" \\

It turns out that the answer is often yes, and the Mean Value Theorem tells us some situations in which the answer is yes.  \\

\textbf{The Mean Value Theorem (MVT)}
\end{center}

Suppose $y = f(x)$ is a function such that \\

\begin{enumerate}

\item $f$ is continuous on the closed interval $[a,b]$ \\

\item $f$ is differentiable on the interval's interior $(a,b)$.  \\

\end{enumerate}

Then there is \textit{at least one} point $c$ in $(a,b)$ at which \\

$$\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b-a} = f'(c)$$

\vspace{1in}
Interpretations of the difference quotient: \\

\begin{enumerate}

\item The slope of the secant line through the points $(a, f(a))$ and $(b, f(b))$. \\

\item The average (``mean") rate of change of $f(x)$ on the interval $[a,b]$. \\

\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Examples:} \\

\textit{If the MVT is applicable (check first), find the value(s) of $c$ that satisfy the conclusion of the MVT.}  \\

\begin{enumerate}

\item $f(x) = x^2 + 2x -1, [0,1]$ \\

\item Fred enters a 60 mph highway at 7:30 with his friends Daphne, Velma, Shaggy and their dog Scooby. They stay on the highway for 20 miles and exit the highway at 7:45. They are immediately pulled over by the police.  Why did he get pulled over?  (Hint: Use the MVT - be sure to justify why you can use it!)

\end{enumerate}

\newpage
\begin{itemize}
	\item[4.] Create a counterexample for the following false statement: \\

\begin{center}
	Suppose $y=f(x)$ is continuous on $[a,b]$. Then there is at least one point $c$ in $(a,b)$ at which $\displaystyle{\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}=f'(c)}$.\\
\end{center}
Make sure your counter example includes all of the following:\\
\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] A clearly defined function $f$ given graphically or with an equation and specific values for $a$ and $b$ (Hint: One of the previous graphs may work here). \\
\vspace{2in}
\item[(ii)] Justify how the given function $f$, and the values $a$ and $b$ satisfy the hypothesis. \\
\vspace{1in}
\item[(iii)] Explain how the conclusion is not satisfied: This means you must show that there are no points $c$ in $(a,b)$
 at which $\displaystyle{\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}=f'(c)}$.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Additional Examples and Explanations:} \\

\emph{\underline{Check Point}}: Find the value(s) of $c$ that satisfy the equation in the conclusion of the MVT for\\
$f(x)=e^{\frac{1}{3}x}$ on the interval $[0,3]$

\bigskip

\textcolor{blue}{Is $f(x)$ continuous on the interval $[0,3]$?} \textcolor{red}{Yes! ($f$ is continuous everywhere.)}

\textcolor{blue}{Is $f(x)$ differentiable on the interval $(1,3)$?} \textcolor{red}{Yes! $f'(x)=\displaystyle{\frac{1}{3}e^{\frac{1}{3}x}}$.}

\textcolor{blue}{Find $c$ in $(0,3)$:} 

\textcolor{red}{$$\frac{f(3)-f(0)}{3-0}=f'(c)$$}
\textcolor{red}{$$\frac{e^{1}-e^{0}}{3}=\displaystyle{\frac{1}{3}e^{\frac{1}{3}x}}$$}
\textcolor{red}{$$e-1=\displaystyle{e^{\frac{1}{3}x}}$$}
\textcolor{red}{$$\ln(e-1)=\ln\left(e^{\frac{1}{3}x}\right)$$}
\textcolor{red}{$$\ln(e-1)=\frac{1}{3}x\Rightarrow x=3\ln(e-1)\approx 1.624$$}

\bigskip

\emph{\underline{Check Point}}: Why might the MVT's conclusion be untrue if $f(x)$ were \textbf{not continuous} on $[a,b]$?

\textcolor{red}{Lots of possibilities here.  The key is that if you don't have the continuity on the closed interval and differentiability on the open interval, then you are not guaranteed the conclusion.}
