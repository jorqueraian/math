You may print the file to answer questions on paper or use your own paper and write down the questions by hand, or write answers digitally. Take special care to write neatly and in complete sentences. Write your name on every page. If your instructor asks you to submit your homework digitally on Canvas, it must be ONE file in pdf format. If you need help with this, ask your instructor or visit the Calculus Center.

\vspace{.1in}
Resources: You are strongly encouraged to consult your notes, any materials from class and the textbook, and visit the Calculus Center and work with classmates. If you get help in the calculus center, you can discuss concepts, but any specific problems must be different from what is on the assignment. If you work with a classmate, make sure that any writing or drawings you submit are your own work.  You instructor may ask you to explain verbally any work on your written work, so make sure you understand what you've written down well enough to do this. You are not authorized to upload this document or images of this document to any online tutoring or AI service.

    Snell's Law or the Law of Refraction describes the behavior of light as it 
    travels between two substances, telling us how light bends.
    \begin{multicols}{2}

    Snell's law tells us about the relationship between the angle of incidence $\theta_1$
    and the angle of refraction $\theta_2$ as a ray of light travels from one medium 
    to another and depends on the refraction indices $n_1$ and $n_2$ of both of 
    the substance.

\begin{enumerate}
        \item (D9) Use Implicit differentiation to compute $\displaystyle{\frac{d\theta_2}{d\theta_1}}$
        \item The refraction index of air is $n_1=1$ and the refraction index of glass is $n_2=1.52$. 
        If the angle of incidence is $\theta_1=20^\circ$ verify that the angle 
        of refraction is approximately $\theta_2\approx 13^\circ$. 
        (Make sure you calculator is in degrees mode)
        \item (D10) Find an equation for the tangent line when $\theta_1=20^\circ$ and $\theta_2= 13^\circ$
        \item (D10) Use your tangent line to approximate the value of $\theta_2$ when $\theta_1=21^\circ$
