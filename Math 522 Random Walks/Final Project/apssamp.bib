	abstract = {Single particle tracking is a powerful technique for investigating the dynamic behavior of biological molecules. However, many of the analytical tools are prone to generate results that can lead to mistaken interpretations of the underlying transport process. Here, we explore the effects of localization error and confinement on the velocity autocorrelation function, Cυ. We show that calculation of Cυ across a range of discretizations can distinguish the effects of localization error, confinement, and medium elasticity. Thus, under certain regimes, Cυ can be used as a diagnostic tool to identify the underlying mechanism of anomalous diffusion. Finally, we apply our analysis to experimental data sets of chromosomal loci and RNA-protein particles in Escherichia coli.},

This book describes diffusion and transport in disordered media such as fractals, porous rocks and random resistor networks.

Part II covers anomalous diffusion in fractals and disordered media, while Part III serves as an introduction to the kinetics of diffusion-limited reactions. Part IV discusses the problem of diffusion-limited coalescence in one dimension. This book will be of particular interest to researchers requiring a clear introduction to the field. It will also be of interest to graduate students studying in areas of physics, chemistry, and engineering.},

The particles’ mean squared displacement is found to depend on the way the mean is taken: temporal averaging over single-particle trajectories differs from averaging over an ensemble of particles. This is shown to stem from subordinating an ergodic anomalous process to a nonergodic one. The result is easily generalized to the subordination of any other ergodic process (i.e., fractional Brownian motion) to a nonergodic one. For certain parameters the ergodic diffusion on the underlying fractal structure dominates the transport yet displaying ergodicity breaking and aging.},

Here, we study the physical mechanism underlying Kv2.1 potassium channel anomalous dynamics using single-molecule tracking. Our analysis includes both time series of individual trajectories and ensemble averages. We show that an ergodic and a nonergodic process coexist in the plasma membrane. The ergodic process resembles a fractal structure with its origin in macromolecular crowding in the cell membrane. The nonergodic process is found to be regulated by transient binding to the actin cytoskeleton and can be accurately modeled by a continuous-time random walk. When the cell is treated with drugs that inhibit actin polymerization, the diffusion pattern of Kv2.1 channels recovers ergodicity. However, the fractal structure that induces anomalous diffusion remains unaltered. These results have direct implications on the regulation of membrane receptor trafficking and signaling.},

We addressed this problem by imaging the cortical actin at high resolution while simultaneously tracking individual membrane proteins in live mammalian cells. Our data confirm that actin introduces barriers leading to compartmentalization of the plasma membrane and that membrane proteins are transiently confined within actin fences. Furthermore, superresolution imaging shows that the cortical actin is organized into a self-similar meshwork. These results present a hierarchical nanoscale picture of the plasma membrane.},

	abstract = {Time-dependent processes are often analyzed using the power spectral density (PSD) calculated by taking an appropriate Fourier transform of individual trajectories and finding the associated ensemble average. Frequently, the available experimental datasets are too small for such ensemble averages, and hence, it is of a great conceptual and practical importance to understand to which extent relevant information can be gained from S(f,T), the PSD of a single trajectory. Here we focus on the behavior of this random, realization-dependent variable parametrized by frequency f and observation time T, for a broad family of anomalous diffusions—fractional Brownian motion with Hurst index H—and derive exactly its probability density function. We show that S(f,T) is proportional—up to a random numerical factor whose universal distribution we determine—to the ensemble-averaged PSD. For subdiffusion (H{\textless}1/2), we find that S(f,T)∼A/f2H+1 with random amplitude A. In sharp contrast, for superdiffusion (H{\textgreater}1/2) S(f,T)∼BT2H−1/f2 with random amplitude B. Remarkably, for H{\textgreater}1/2 the PSD exhibits the same frequency dependence as Brownian motion, a deceptive property that may lead to false conclusions when interpreting experimental data. Notably, for H{\textgreater}1/2 the PSD is ageing and is dependent on T. Our predictions for both sub- and superdiffusion are confirmed by experiments in live cells and in agarose hydrogels and by extensive simulations.},

Random walks have been studied for many decades on both regular lattices and (especially in the last couple of decades) on networks with a variety of structures. In the present article, we survey the theory and applications of random walks on networks, restricting ourselves to simple cases of single and non-adaptive random walkers. We distinguish three main types of random walks: discrete-time random walks, node-centric continuous-time random walks, and edge-centric continuous-time random walks. We first briefly survey random walks on a line, and then we consider random walks on various types of networks. We extensively discuss applications of random walks, including ranking of nodes (e.g., {PageRank}), community detection, respondent-driven sampling, and opinion models such as voter models.},

	abstract = {We suggest that the concept of self-organized criticality (SOC) is relevant for understanding the processes underlying earthquakes. Earthquakes are an important part of the relaxation mechanism of the crust which is submitted to inhomogeneous increasing stresses accumulating at continental-plate borders. The SOC concept then implies that earthquakes in turn organize the crust both at the spatial and temporal levels. This idea allows to rationalize observations on occurrences and magnitudes of earthquakes. Variants of SOC as well as a novel type of dynamics based on “waiting times” are discussed within a mean-field-like approach which shows the existence of 1/f noise in the time gap between large earthquakes. The corresponding long-time correlations have important implications for the statistical long-time forecasting of earthquakes.},
