	abstract = {Computing the minimum distance of a linear code is a fundamental problem in coding theory. This problem is a special case of the Matroid Girth problem, where the objective is to compute the length of a shortest circuit in a given matroid. A closely related problem on matroids is the Matroid Connectivity problem where the objective is to compute the connectivity of a given matroid. Given a matroid \$\$M=(E,{\textbackslash}mathcal\{I\})\$\$M=(E,I), a k-separation of M is a partition (X, Y) of E such that \$\${\textbar}X{\textbar}{\textbackslash}ge k,{\textbackslash};{\textbar}Y{\textbar}{\textbackslash}ge k\$\${\textbar}X{\textbar}≥k,{\textbar}Y{\textbar}≥kand \$\$r(X)+r(Y)-r(E){\textbackslash}le k-1\$\$r(X)+r(Y)-r(E)≤k-1, where r is the rank function. The connectivity of a matroid M is the smallest k such that M has a k-separation.},
