\begin{itemize}
   \item[(1)]
   Let $S,T$ be subgroups of a group $G$ and consider the double 
   cosets of $S$. Consider a double coset $SgT$ and notice that this is equal to the 
   orbit of the coset $Sg$ acted on by multiplication by $T$. This is the 
   case because $(Sg)^T=\{Sgt | t\in T\}=SgT$.
   
   

   \item[(2)] Let $G=\ip{a=(1,2,\dots,100), b= (1,2)}=S_{100}$. The representatives, 
   using the algorithm from class would be as follows: the representative for $2$ would
    be $(1,2,\dots,100)$ and more generally the representative for $k$ would be
    $(1,2,\dots,100)^{k-1}$. A generating set which shorter representations could be 
    $\ip{a=(1,2,\dots,100), b= (1,33), c=(1,66)}$ in which case no representative would
    have more then $34$ multiplications, while in the previous generating set the 
    number of multiplication would be much longer.
   
    \item[(3)] Assume that $G$ is a finite group. And let $M_1$ be a maximal subgroup of $G$
               where we know that $[G:M_1]\geq 2$. Pick an element $m_1\in G$ 
               such that $m_1\not\in M_1$. We can repeat this process inductively on a
               chain of maximum subgroups $M_{k}\leq M_{k-1}$ by
               picking an element $m_k\in M_{k-1}$ where $m_k\not\in M_k$. Each maximal subgroup has
               index $\geq 2$ meaning there are most $\log_2(|G|)$ steps in this process, 
               meaning there are at most $\log_2(|G|)$ elements, all of which generate $G$.

   \item[(4)] 
   \begin{itemize}
      \item[(a)] The probability that any single element is in $U$ is $\frac{1}{n}$ and 
      because each element is chosen randomly the probability that all $k$ elements are in $U$
      is $\frac{1}{n^k}$.
      \item[(b)] Consider the group action of $G$ acting on the subgroups of $G$ by conjugation.
                 In this case The orbit of $U$ is the conjugates of $U$. And the stabilizer
                 is the normalizer of $U$ in $G$. And so by orbit-stabilizer $|U^G|=[g:N_G(U)]$. Furthermore 
                 because $U\leq N_G(U)$ we know that $|U^G|=[G:N_G(U)]\leq [G:U] =n$. And 
                 because the conjugated of $U$ are subgroup of the same size as $U$ the probability 
                 of any $k$ elements being in any single conjugate of $U$ is $\frac{1}{n^k}$ 
                 but because there are at most $n$ conjugates the probability of all $k$ elements 
                 being in the same conjugate is $\leq n\cdot\frac{1}{n^k}=\frac{1}{n^{k-1}}$.


      \item[(c)]  Notice first that the conjugacy classes of the maximal subgroups is a partition 
      and from part (b) we can determine that for any conjugacy class the probability 
      of any $k$ elements being in the same conjugate in that conjugacy class is 
      $\frac{1}{n^{k-1}}\leq \frac{1}{2^{k-1}}$ where $n$ is the index. 
      And so because there are $m$ conjugacy classes that partition the maximal subgroups
      the probability that $k$ elements are in any single maximal subgroup is $\leq m\frac{1}{2^{k-1}}$.
      Notice that if $k$ elements are not contained in any maximal subgroups they must generate all of $G$
      so the probability that $k$ elements generate $G$ is $\geq 1-m\frac{1}{2^{k-1}}$. And so if $2^{k-2}>m$
      the probability that $k$ elements generate $G$ is $\geq 1-m\frac{1}{2^{k-1}}\geq 1-\frac{1}{2}=2$.


   \end{itemize}
   \item[(5)] Let $G=\ip{g}$ be a cyclic group. We know that the number of non-trivial 
   Schreier generators is $|w^G|\cdot (|\underbar{g}|-1)+1=1$. This makes sense because in the
   algorithm there is only one generator and so the step $\gamma\in \Delta$ only occurs 
   once when $g^kw=w$ for some minimal non-zero $k$ which closes the orbit and all elements 
   in $\Delta$ have been iterated over. So the else clause only happens once.

   \item[(6)] I've installed GAP on WSL for Debian
   %Note i needed to apt-get install gcc g++ clang make m4 libzmq3-dev libgmp-dev -y before running config and make and stuff
   %Need to rebuild shit.
