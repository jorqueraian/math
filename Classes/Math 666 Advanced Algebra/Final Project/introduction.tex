\section{Introduction}
This paper is meant as a way of documenting my understanding of 
algebra with an emphasis on how and why algebra is the way it is, 
and so may be obvious or even outright insulting to a trained algebraist.
I've come to the conclusion the conclusion that Algebra is a 4 step process:
Step 1) Find example of algebra in the real word. 
Step 2) Using your examples (a) find operators, or a grammar and (b) find laws that your operators seem to follow your examples. This step we create the "free" algebra
Step 3) Study your newly built algebra by (a) studying the "simple" things. (b) study the "free" thing. (c) study the representations.
step 4) idk study your examples again with new insights or don't.

\subsection{Step 1: A Motivating Example}
Matrices are cool. Thats it! Thats all the motivation I need.
Groups can be used to talk about the algebra of multiplying 
invertible matrices with common dimensions, with the General Linear group.
Groupoids can be used to work with all square matrices. And a Category can be 
used to study the behavior of matrix multiplication in general. However these 
three algebra leave gaps, categories and groupoids can often be too broad, allowing
for partially defined multiplications while group are too narrow, allowing only 
invertible matrices.

Often one may want to study rectangular matrices. For example Let $V^+$ be the 
$k$-module of $q\times p$ matrices $M_{q,p}$ and $V^-$ be the 
$k$-module of $p\times q$ matrices $M_{p,q}$. These matrices are clearly compatible under 
multiplication but there is a problem! If $A\in V^+$ and $B\in V^-$, then their product is in neither
of the original modules. This requires a new operator, a trinary operation where if $A,C\in V^+$ and $B\in V^-$
then $ABC\in V^+$ and vice-versa. In fact this trinary operator would be tri-linear.
This would give us a nice algebra, but it has a problem, it does not behave nicely with geometry.
Geometry often looks at bilinear forms which can often be defined by a transpose. 
However notice with this simple triple product we have that $ABC$ is bilinear in $A$ and $C$ but notice that 
under a transpose $(ABC)^t=C^tB^tA^t$ we have a commuting issue. And so instead we want to define an operator
that is symmetric in $A$ and $C$. An easy way to do this is to define an operator $\{A,B,C\}=ABC+CBA$.


A simpler example of this commuting issue is with symmetric(self-adjoint) matrices, where $A=A^t$ and $B=B^t$. 
If we had a bilinear form: $\ip{x|y}=x^ty$ we could study the self adjoint elements $\ip{Ax|y}=\ip{x|A^ty}$. 
But we run into the exact same problem: that symmetric matrices are generally not closed under multiplication
$(AB)^t=B^tA^t=BA$. And restricting you study of matrices to commutative ones is not a reasonable ask! 
So again the fix is to invent a new matrix multiplication that is symmetric and still does all the same things.


\subsection{Step 2: Fumbling to a Definition}
We are not saying Ottmar Loos Fumbled to the definitions we will present below 
(They are simply too nice and also intricate for that to be the case) but at some point to do
algebra you have to just fumble to something that looks good enough, and hopefully in retrospect you can convince yourself
why your algebra is a good one.

As mentioned above we want to create an algebra that looks at how pairs of modules interact, through a symmetric 
trilinear operator that we will think about as being our triple matrix product symmetricified.
So we need to define our two $k$-modules with our trilinear operator that goes between them

\begin{align*}\ip{\ip{V^+}}::&= 0_+ \\
                             &| \ip{V^+}+\ip{V^+} \\
                             &| -\ip{V^+} \\
                             &| \ip{k}\cdot \ip{V^+}\\ 
                             &| \{\ip{V^+}, \ip{V^-}, \ip{V^+}\}\end{align*}
\begin{align*}\ip{\ip{V^-}}::&= 0_- \\
    &| \ip{V^-}+\ip{V^-} \\
    &| -\ip{V^-} \\
    &| \ip{k}\cdot \ip{V^-} \\
    &| \{\ip{V^-}, \ip{V^+}, \ip{V^-}\}\end{align*}
 
And then we can define the grammar for the algebra of the pair of modules. This is the signature for a Jordan pair over $k$

\[\ip{\ip{\text{JP}_k}}::= \ip{V^+} | \ip{V^-}\]

Now that we know what operators we have in our world we need laws to tell us what these operators mean and how we can rewrite expressions.
First we need the laws that tell us that $V^+$ and $V^-$ are in fact $k$-modules.
And we also need the laws that tell about our triple product, that $\{-,-,-\}:V^\sigma\times V^{-\sigma}\times V^\sigma\ra V^\sigma$ is a trilinear operator and symmetric in the first and third terms. 

From these laws we can create additional operators: for $\sigma=\pm$ let
\[Q_\sigma:V^\sigma\ra \hom(V^{-\sigma},V^{\sigma})\text{ be quadratic maps given by }2Q_\sigma(x)y = \{xyx\}\]
We can also create their corresponding symmetric bilinear maps 
$Q_\sigma:V^\sigma\times V^\sigma\ra \hom(V^{-\sigma},V^{\sigma})$ which are given by 
$Q_\sigma(x,z)=Q_\sigma(x+z)-Q_\sigma(x)-Q_\sigma(z)$. %TODO make sure this actually works. I think i might have an off by 1/2 or 2.
Finally we will create the bilinear maps $D_\sigma(x,y)z=Q_\sigma(x,z)y$
Notice that in the example in the section above we would have that $Q_\sigma(x)y=xyx$.

Now that we have our algebra with some initial laws we need to build some more laws using the formulas of $\text{JP}_k$.
These laws are created to mirror the behavior of our motivating examples.
We will build the following laws:
\begin{equation}
    \tag{JP1}
    \{x,y,Q_\sigma(x)z\}=Q_\sigma(x)\{y,x,z\}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \tag{JP2}
    \{Q_\sigma(x)y,y,z\}=\{x,Q_{-\sigma}(y)x,z\}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \tag{JP3}
    Q_{\sigma}(Q_{\sigma}(x)y)z=Q_{\sigma}(x)(Q_{-\sigma}(y)(Q_{\sigma}(x)z))
\end{equation}


Combining these laws we have the following definition of a Jordan Pair

\begin{definition}
    The pair $V=(V^+,V^-)$ is called a Jordan pair if $V\vDash_{\text{JP}_k}\mathcal{L}$ where $\mathcal{L}$ 
    are the laws outlined above. More Concisely we may say that a pair $V=(V^+,V^-)$ of $k$-modules
    along with a pair of quadratic maps $(Q_+,Q_-)$, which define the trilinear operator $\{-,-,-\}$, is called a Jordan pair if JP1-JP3 hold in all scalar extensions of $V$
    \begin{equation}
        \tag{JP1}
        \{x,y,Q_\sigma(x)z\}=Q_\sigma(x)\{y,x,z\}
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
        \tag{JP2}
        \{Q_\sigma(x)y,y,z\}=\{x,Q_{-\sigma}(y)x,z\}
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
        \tag{JP3}
        Q_{\sigma}(Q_{\sigma}(x)y)z=Q_{\sigma}(x)(Q_{-\sigma}(y)(Q_{\sigma}(x)z))
    \end{equation}
\end{definition}
Now that we have a definition for our algebra we can define what it means to have sub-objects, 
homomorphisms, congruences, quotients and ideals. None of the following are particularly surprising (You see what I did there? Im acting like a trained algebraist)
\begin{definition}
    A homomorphism $h:V\ra W$ of Jordan Pairs is a pair of maps $(h_+,h_-)$ such that $h_\sigma:V^\sigma\ra W^\sigma$ is a 
    $k$-module homomorphism such that the following holds
    \begin{equation}
        h_{\sigma}(\{x,y,z\})=\{h_{\sigma}(x),h_{-\sigma}(y),h_{\sigma}(z)\}
    \end{equation}
    This condition is equivalent to 
    \begin{equation}
        h_{\sigma}(Q_{\sigma}(x)y)=Q_{\sigma}(h_{\sigma}(x))h_{-\sigma}(y)
    \end{equation}
\end{definition}

Once we have a homomorphism we can talk about congruences of homomorphism: 
\begin{definition}
    Let $h$ be a homomorphism of Jordan Pairs then $\ker(h)=\{x\equiv z \pmod h | h(x)=h(z)\}$
\end{definition}
Because of the underlying module structure we have that %$x\equiv z \pmod h$ is equivalent to $x-z\equiv 0_\sigma \pmod h$

\begin{prop}
    The Kernel of a homomorphism $h:V\ra W$ of Jordan Pairs is equivalent to a sub-object of the Jordan Pair $V$. 
    That is we may consider the $\ker(h)=\{x\in V | h(x)=0_\sigma\}$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
    Notice that using the $k$-module structure we have that $x\equiv z \pmod h$ if and only if $x-z\equiv 0_\sigma \pmod h$.
\end{proof}

Now that we have our notion of a congruence or a kernel we can define an ideal 
\begin{definition}
    $I=(I^+,I^-)$ is an ideal of $V$ if $I$ is the kernel of some homomorphism $h: V\ra W$.
\end{definition}
This gives us a special case of Noethers Isomorphism theorem relating homomorphism, ideals and Quotients 
\begin{prop}
    $I=(I^+,I^-)$ is sub-object of $V$ such that nasty thing if and only if $V/I$ is a Jordan Pair and $H:V\ra V/I$ is a homomorphism
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}

\end{proof}

\subsection{Step 3: Studying The Algebra}
Now that we have created the algebra of Jordan Pairs we need to study it.
